For tier one platforms, pre-cooked libraries are included in-tree and so building should be as easy
as invoking make. For other platforms, building is still possible but more work will be required.
Due to time constraints, an elaborate build system is a low priority item.

Dependencies:
    boost
    fltk
    sqlite *
    
* sqlite is small enough and standards compliant enough that the entire source is included in-tree.

Other combinations _should_ also work.
    
Tier one platforms: x86.win32.msvc2010

to build:
1. first run vcvarsall.bat x86 from a shell, or just use (Visual Studio Command Prompt 2010 x86)
2. > cd [..]\elevatorSim
3. > nmake /nologo /f makefile.x86.win32.msvc2010
